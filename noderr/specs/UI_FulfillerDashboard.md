# UI_FulfillerDashboard.md

## Purpose
To provide a tactical, actionable dashboard for members of the fulfillment teams (e.g., Legal, Security, Finance). This dashboard is designed to show them the work that is currently in their queue, helping them manage and prioritize their assigned tasks.

## Current Implementation Status
âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Component exists and is functional

## Implementation Details
- **Location**: `src/fluent/generated/par_dashboard_89f4dc35933e6a50d5ec31697bba10df.now.ts` (This file represents the `par_dashboard` record).
- **Current interfaces**: This is a UI component accessed via the ServiceNow navigator under "Partner Onboarding Requests > Dashboards". Its visibility is controlled by roles.
- **Dependencies**: `MODEL_Task`, `ACL_TaskRecords` (to allow the widgets to read the data).
- **Dependents**: Fulfillers (users with the `user` role) who use this dashboard to manage their work.

## Core Logic & Functionality
This component is a container for list-based reports that act as work queues. It does not contain business logic itself but arranges and displays filtered lists of tasks. The key widgets it contains are:
-   **My Group's Unassigned Tasks:** A list report showing all active tasks assigned to any group the current user is a member of, but which have not yet been assigned to an individual. This acts as the group's incoming work queue.
-   **My Assigned Tasks:** A list report showing all active tasks assigned directly to the current user. This acts as the individual's personal work queue.

## Current Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: The dashboard provides the essential views a fulfiller needs to manage their workload.
- **Code Quality**: N/A (This is a configured UI component). The layout is simple and effective.
- **Test Coverage**: The visibility of the dashboard can be manually tested by impersonating a fulfiller.
- **Documentation**: The dashboard and its widgets have clear, action-oriented titles.

## Technical Debt & Improvement Areas
- None identified.

## Interface Definition
```
// This is a UI component, not an API.
// Access: Navigate to "Partner Onboarding Requests > Dashboards" in the ServiceNow UI.
// Required Role: x_1118046_partne_0.user
```

## ARC Verification Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- [ ] Verify that a user with the `user` role can view the dashboard.
- [ ] Verify that a user without the `user` role (e.g., a standard requester) cannot access the dashboard.
- [ ] Verify that the "My Group's Unassigned Tasks" widget correctly displays only tasks assigned to the user's group(s) and where `assigned_to` is empty.
- [ ] Verify that the "My Assigned Tasks" widget correctly displays only tasks where the `assigned_to` field is the current user.
- [ ] Verify that clicking on a task in either list opens the correct task record form.

### Input Validation Criteria  
- [ ] N/A

### Error Handling Criteria
- [ ] Verify that if a user has no assigned tasks, the widgets display a "No records to display" message rather than an error.

### Quality Criteria
- [ ] The dashboard layout should be simple and focused on actionability for the fulfiller.
- [ ] The list reports should display the most relevant columns for a fulfiller to prioritize their work.
