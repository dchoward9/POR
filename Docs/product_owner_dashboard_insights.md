### The Core Five: "Is This Thing Working and Was It Worth It?"

These are the non-negotiable, at-a-glance insights every business process owner needs on their main dashboard.

#### 1. Insight: Are We More Efficient? (The ROI Dashboard)
This is the "show me the money" insight. It answers whether the new digital solution is saving the time, effort, and money that was promised in the business case.

*   **Why it Matters:** Directly justifies the investment in the technology and the consultants. It's the primary measure of ROI.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets:**
    *   **KPI Card:** `Average Time to Completion` (e.g., average time to resolve an HR case, close a sales opportunity, or fulfill a service request).
    *   **Line Chart:** `Manual vs. Automated Steps` showing a decrease in manual "touches" per process over time.
    *   **KPI Card:** `Cost Per Transaction` (if calculable), showing a downward trend.

#### 2. Insight: What is Our Team's Workload and Throughput?
This dashboard shows how much work is flowing through the process and whether the team can handle it. It's the operational health check.

*   **Why it Matters:** Essential for resource planning, identifying team burnout risk, and understanding the capacity of the process.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets:**
    *   **Bar Chart:** `Open vs. Closed Items by Week/Month` to visualize flow.
    *   **KPI Card:** `Current Open Backlog` (total number of active cases/tickets).
    *   **Donut Chart:** `Work Distribution by Category` (e.g., 40% Onboarding, 30% Payroll Issues, 30% Benefits).
    *   **(Implemented in POR via the `POR Fulfillers Dashboard`, which shows unassigned and assigned task lists.)**

#### 3. Insight: Is the Quality of Our Work Improving?
Efficiency is meaningless if the work is sloppy. This insight tracks whether the process is producing accurate, high-quality outcomes, reducing rework and errors.

*   **Why it Matters:** Poor quality erodes customer/employee trust and creates expensive rework that negates efficiency gains.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets:**
    *   **KPI Card:** `First Contact Resolution (FCR) %` - The percentage of issues solved on the first try.
    *   **Line Chart:** `Re-open Rate %` - The percentage of "completed" items that have to be re-opened. A downward trend is ideal.
    *   **KPI Card:** `Error Rate` (e.g., number of payroll errors per 1000 employees).

#### 4. Insight: Are People Actually Using the New System? (The Adoption Dashboard)
A perfect solution that nobody uses is a complete failure. This insight tracks whether end-users (both customers and internal teams) are adopting the new tool as intended.

*   **Why it Matters:** Adoption is the leading indicator of value realization. Low adoption signals that the solution is too complex, doesn't solve the real problem, or requires more training.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets:**
    *   **Line Chart:** `Active Users per Day/Week` to track engagement.
    *   **Table:** `Top 10 "Searches with No Results"` in the self-service portal, highlighting knowledge gaps.
    *   **KPI Card:** `Self-Service vs. Agent-Created Tickets` to measure channel shift.

#### 5. Insight: Where Are the Bottlenecks in Our Process?
This is the most actionable insight for continuous improvement. It pinpoints exactly where work is getting stuck, waiting for people, information, or another system.

*   **Why it Matters:** It tells you exactly where to focus your next improvement effort. Fixing the biggest bottleneck provides the biggest gain in overall speed.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets:**
    *   **Bar Chart:** `Average Time in Stage` (e.g., showing work sits in "Awaiting Approval" for 3 days but "In Progress" for only 4 hours). **(Implemented in POR via the 'Average Time per Stage' report on the Admin Dashboard.)**
    *   **Table:** `Aging Report by Stage` showing the oldest items stuck in the process and where they are.
    *   **KPI Card:** `Number of Items Awaiting External Input`.

### The Next Five: Strategic and Forward-Looking Insights

These insights help the PO move from day-to-day operations to strategic planning and long-term process health.

#### 6. Insight: Are We Meeting Our Promises? (SLA Performance)
This is about accountability. Are we delivering the level of service we promised to our customers, employees, or other business units?

*   **Why it Matters:** Crucial for building trust and managing stakeholder relationships. In some cases, it has contractual or financial implications.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets:**
    *   **Gauge/KPI Card:** `Overall SLA Achievement %`.
    *   **Bar Chart:** `Top Reasons for SLA Breaches` (e.g., "Awaiting Customer," "Dependency on Team X").

#### 7. Insight: What Are People Asking For? (Demand Analysis)
This dashboard moves from looking at the process to looking at the *demand* for the process. It helps anticipate future needs and identify trends.

*   **Why it Matters:** Informs strategic decisions about what services to offer, automate, or eliminate. It helps you get ahead of the curve.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets:**
    *   **Heat Map/Bar Chart:** `Request Volume by Business Unit, Location, or Category over Time`.
    *   **Trend Line:** `Growth in Requests for New Services`.

#### 8. Insight: How Does Our Performance Impact the Broader Business?
This is the holy grail: connecting the performance of your process to a top-level company objective (e.g., revenue, customer retention, employee satisfaction).

*   **Why it Matters:** This elevates the conversation from "operational efficiency" to "strategic value," securing executive buy-in and future investment.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets (often requires combining data sources):**
    *   **Correlation Chart:** `Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) vs. Average Ticket Resolution Time`.
    *   **KPI:** `Impact of Employee Onboarding Time on Time-to-Productivity`.

#### 9. Insight: Are We Successfully Deflecting Work to Self-Service?
For any process with a service portal or knowledge base, this is a key measure of success. The goal is to solve problems before they become tickets.

*   **Why it Matters:** Self-service is the cheapest and fastest form of resolution. High deflection frees up expert teams for high-value, complex work.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets:**
    *   **KPI Card:** `Ticket Deflection Rate %` (e.g., (KB Views + Portal Views) / Tickets Created).
    *   **Funnel Chart:** `Portal Search > KB Article View > Ticket Submitted` to see where users drop off.

#### 10. Insight: Where is Our Operational Risk?
This dashboard highlights potential compliance failures, overdue tasks, and other risks that could cause a major business problem.

*   **Why it Matters:** Provides an early warning system to prevent critical failures, especially in regulated areas like Finance, HR, or Legal.
*   **Common Dashboard Metrics/Widgets:**
    *   **List/Table:** `Overdue Approvals by Manager`.
    *   **KPI Card:** `Number of Automated Controls that Failed`.
    *   **Alert:** `Critical Tasks Nearing Compliance Deadline`.
