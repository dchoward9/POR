# UI_AdminDashboard.md

## Purpose
To provide a high-level, administrative overview of the entire Partner Onboarding process. This dashboard aggregates key metrics and reports, allowing administrators to monitor system health, identify bottlenecks, and track overall performance.

## Current Implementation Status
âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Component exists and is functional

## Implementation Details
- **Location**: `src/fluent/generated/par_dashboard_9e1a503d933e6a50d5ec31697bba10c2.now.ts` (This file represents the `par_dashboard` record).
- **Current interfaces**: This is a UI component accessed via the ServiceNow navigator under "Partner Onboarding Requests > Dashboards". Its visibility is controlled by roles.
- **Dependencies**: `UI_AdminDashboardWidgets`, `MODEL_Request`, `ACL_RequestRecords` (to allow the widgets to read the data).
- **Dependents**: Administrators who use this dashboard for process oversight.

## Core Logic & Functionality
This component is a container for various data visualizations (widgets). It does not contain business logic itself but arranges and displays reports that do. The key widgets it contains are:
-   **Total Open Requests:** A single score KPI showing the count of all active requests.
-   **Requests by Stage:** A pie chart showing the distribution of active requests across all workflow stages.
-   **Average Time per Stage:** A bar chart displaying the average duration requests spend in each stage, helping to identify bottlenecks.
-   **Request Outcomes (Last 90 Days):** A bar chart comparing the number of completed vs. canceled requests over the last quarter.

## Current Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the key metrics for the onboarding process.
- **Code Quality**: N/A (This is a configured UI component). The layout is clean and logical.
- **Test Coverage**: The visibility of the dashboard is checked in the `TEST_ATFSuite`.
- **Documentation**: The dashboard has a clear title and description.

## Technical Debt & Improvement Areas
- None identified.
