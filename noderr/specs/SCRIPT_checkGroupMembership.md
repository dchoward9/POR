# SCRIPT_checkGroupMembership.md

## Purpose
To provide a reusable, server-side utility for checking if a given user is a member of a specific group. This is a core security and logic utility used by client scripts to make decisions without exposing sensitive logic to the browser.

## Current Implementation Status
âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Component exists and is functional

## Implementation Details
- **Location**: `src/fluent/generated/sys_script_include_55300b669376ae50d5ec31697bba109c.now.ts` (This file represents the Script Include record).
- **Current interfaces**: This is a client-callable Script Include. It exposes a method `getMembershipAjax` that can be called via GlideAjax.
- **Dependencies**: Relies on the `sys_user_grmember` table, which stores the relationships between users and groups.
- **Dependents**: `SCRIPT_CheckExemption` and `SCRIPT_PopulateManager` both call this script include to determine if a user is in the approval exemption group.

## Core Logic & Functionality
1.  The script extends `AbstractAjaxProcessor`, making it callable from the client.
2.  The `getMembershipAjax` function is the public-facing method for the GlideAjax call.
3.  It retrieves the `sysparm_user_id` and `sysparm_group_id` parameters sent from the client.
4.  It calls a private helper function, `getMembership`, to perform the actual database query.
5.  The `getMembership` function queries the `sys_user_grmember` table.
6.  The query looks for a record where the `user` field matches the provided user ID AND the `group` field matches the provided group ID.
7.  If a record is found (`userIsGroupMember.next()` returns true), the function returns `true`.
8.  If no record is found, it returns `false`.
9.  The result is returned to the client-side caller.

## Current Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: The script correctly and securely checks for group membership.
- **Code Quality**: The script is efficient and secure. By performing the check on the server, it prevents users from spoofing client-side logic. The logic is properly encapsulated.
- **Test Coverage**: This script is a critical part of the "POR Approval Exemption" test in the ATF suite (`TEST_ATFSuite`).
- **Documentation**: The script include has a clear name.

## Technical Debt & Improvement Areas
- None identified. This is a well-designed and reusable utility.

## Interface Definition
```javascript
// Client-side GlideAjax call pattern
var ga = new GlideAjax('x_1118046_partne_0.checkGroupMembership');
ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getMembershipAjax');
ga.addParam('sysparm_user_id', 'some_user_sys_id');
ga.addParam('sysparm_group_id', 'some_group_sys_id');
ga.getXML(callbackFunction);

// The callback function receives a response where the 'answer' attribute is "true" or "false".
```

## ARC Verification Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- [ ] Verify that calling the script with a user who IS a member of the specified group returns `true`.
- [ ] Verify that calling the script with a user who IS NOT a member of the specified group returns `false`.

### Input Validation Criteria  
- [ ] The script should gracefully handle cases where the user ID or group ID is invalid or empty, correctly returning `false`.

### Error Handling Criteria
- [ ] The script should not throw an unhandled exception if the query fails.

### Quality Criteria
- [ ] The script must be client-callable.
- [ ] The core logic must be performed on the server-side to ensure security.
- [ ] The script should be scoped to the application (`x_1118046_partne_0`).
