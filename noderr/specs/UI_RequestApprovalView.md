# UI_RequestApprovalView.md

## Purpose
To provide a simplified, focused form view for managers and other approvers when they are actioning an approval request. This view removes unnecessary fields and sections, presenting only the information needed to make an "approve" or "reject" decision.

## Current Implementation Status
âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Component exists and is functional

## Implementation Details
- **Location**: `metadata/update/sys_ui_section_0922d5f293aeaa10d5ec31697bba10f8.xml` and related `sys_ui_form_sections` records with `view="approval"`.
- **Current interfaces**: This is a UI configuration that defines a specific layout for the `x_1118046_partne_0_requests` table when the "approval" view is requested.
- **Dependencies**: `MODEL_Request`.
- **Dependents**: The approval notification emails (`EMAIL_RequestNotifications`) link to this view.

## Core Logic & Functionality
This component is a collection of UI configuration records that define the "approval" view for the Request form.
-   **View Name:** `approval`
-   **Displayed Fields:** It is configured to display a curated set of the most important fields from the `MODEL_Request` record, such as:
    -   `number`
    -   `requested_by`, `requested_for`, `manager`
    -   `short_description`
    -   All partner information fields (`partner_full_legal_name`, `business_justification`, etc.)
-   **Hidden Sections:** It hides sections that are not relevant to the approval decision, such as the "Work Notes" and "Tasks" related lists, to reduce clutter.

## Current Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: The view is well-defined and provides all necessary information for an approver.
- **Code Quality**: N/A (UI Configuration).
- **Test Coverage**: The approval process is part of the ATF suite, which involves a user approving a request, implicitly using this view.
- **Documentation**: The view is clearly named "approval".

## Technical Debt & Improvement Areas
- None identified.

## Interface Definition
```
// This is a UI configuration, not an API.
// It is accessed by navigating to a Request record and specifying the view.
// Example URL:
// https://ven05123.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=x_1118046_partne_0_requests.do?sys_id=[SYS_ID]&sysparm_view=approval
```
