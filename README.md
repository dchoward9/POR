## üéØ The Business Problem

The current process for onboarding new partners, vendors, and suppliers is manual, inconsistent, and lacks central oversight. It relies on a fragmented system of emails and shared spreadsheets, leading to several key challenges:

*   **Operational Inefficiency:** High manual effort for requesters and fulfillment teams (Legal, Security, Finance, Procurement) results in long onboarding cycle times.
*   **Lack of Visibility:** Stakeholders have no clear way to track the status of a request, leading to constant follow-up inquiries.
*   **Compliance & Audit Risk:** Without a formal, auditable trail, it's difficult to prove that all necessary due diligence and approvals were completed.
*   **No Single Source of Truth:** Critical partner information is scattered across multiple systems, increasing the risk of errors and inconsistent data.

---

## üí° The Solution Vision

This project delivers a dedicated **Partner Onboarding application** on the ServiceNow platform, creating a single source of truth for the entire process.

An employee initiates a request via a simple, intuitive form in the Service Catalog. This submission automatically triggers a master workflow that manages the entire lifecycle: routing for manager approval, creating sequential and conditional tasks for fulfillment teams (Procurement, Legal, Security), and automatically updating the parent request's stage to provide real-time visibility to all stakeholders.

## ‚ú® Key Technical Features

*   **Scoped Application:** A dedicated, encapsulated application to house all logic and data, ensuring maintainability and preventing conflicts with other platform functions.
*   **Custom Tables:** A structured data model extending the base `Task` table to manage `Requests` and their associated fulfillment `Tasks`.
*   **Service Catalog:** A user-friendly **Record Producer** provides a single, standardized entry point for all onboarding requests, with a dynamic front-end powered by **UI Policies** and **Client Scripts**.
*   **Flow Designer:** A powerful orchestration engine automates the entire end-to-end process, from approvals to multi-departmental task creation and status updates.
*   **Role-Based Security:** A granular security model using **Roles** and **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** ensures users only see the data relevant to them.
*   **Platform Analytics:** Three persona-based **dashboards** provide real-time visibility and actionable insights for administrators, managers, and fulfillment teams.
*   **Automated Test Framework (ATF):** A comprehensive test suite validates the end-to-end process to ensure quality and stability through platform upgrades.

## üèÜ Stakeholder Value

This solution delivers clear value to all stakeholders:

*   **For the Business:** Reduces risk with a fully auditable trail, increases velocity by accelerating time-to-value for new partners, and provides data-driven insights for continuous process improvement.
*   **For IT:** The scoped application is scalable, maintainable, and CSDM-aligned, making it easy to manage and extend without impacting the global platform.
*   **For Users (Requesters, Managers, Fulfillers):** Provides a simple "one-stop-shop" for requesters, clear and actionable approvals for managers, and a prioritized work queue for fulfillers, eliminating manual follow-up and administrative overhead.

## üìÇ About the Source Code

The complete source code for this application is available in this repository, structured for use with a modern, source-control-based ServiceNow development workflow.

*   **Application Metadata (`/metadata/update`):** Contains the application's configuration records (such as ACLs, UI Policies, and Flow Designer components) stored as individual XML files.
*   **Scripts (`/src/fluent/generated`):** Contains server-side scripts (Business Rules, Script Includes) represented as TypeScript (`.now.ts`) files, a format used by modern ServiceNow development tools for enhanced readability and type safety.

This repository is intended for **code review and as a demonstration of technical capabilities.**
