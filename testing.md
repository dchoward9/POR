Of course. Based on the documentation provided, here are the high-level steps you would take to implement a MID Server on your Linux VM to bypass the TLS handshake issue.

This process involves reverting the direct connection components you previously configured and then installing and configuring the MID Server to act as the mediator.

### Phase 1: Revert the Direct Connection Configuration

The Certificate, Protocol Profile, and Connection records are only necessary for the direct connection from the PDI to the Docker host. Since the MID Server will now handle this locally, these instance-side configurations must be removed to avoid conflicts.

1.  **Delete the Connection Record:**
    *   Navigate to **Connections & Credentials > Connection & Credential Aliases**.
    *   Open the `Docker` alias and delete the `Linux VM Connection` record from the related list.

2.  **Delete the Protocol Profile:**
    *   Navigate to **System Security > Protocol Profiles**.
    *   Delete the `docker` protocol profile you created.

3.  **Delete the Certificate Record:**
    *   Navigate to **System Definition > Certificates**.
    *   Delete the `VM Keystore` record.

### Phase 2: Install and Configure the MID Server on the Linux VM

This phase follows the standard MID Server installation process outlined in the "Yokohama ServiceNow AI Platform Capabilities" document.

1.  **Create a Dedicated MID Server User in the PDI:**
    *   Create a new user record in your PDI (e.g., `mid.server.user`).
    *   This user **must** be given the `mid_server` role. This is a different user from the `atf.headless.user`.

2.  **Download the MID Server Installer on the Linux VM:**
    *   In your PDI, navigate to **MID Server > Downloads**.
    *   Download the appropriate 64-bit Linux MID Server installation package (`.zip` or installer).
    *   Transfer this package to your Linux VM.

3.  **Run the Installer on the Linux VM:**
    *   Extract the package and run the `installer.sh` script.
    *   When prompted, provide the following information:
        *   Your PDI URL (e.g., `https://devXXXXX.service-now.com`).
        *   The username and password for the dedicated MID Server user you created in Step 1 of this phase.
        *   A unique name for this MID Server (e.g., `Azure_Linux_MID`).

4.  **Validate the MID Server in the PDI:**
    *   After the installation completes, navigate to **MID Server > Servers** in your PDI. You should see your new MID Server record, and its status should eventually change to "Up".
    *   Open the MID Server record and click the **Validate** related link. This marks the MID Server as a trusted component.

### Phase 3: Reconfigure the Integration to Use the MID Server

Finally, you must tell the Docker Spoke (which the ATF action uses) to route its requests through your new MID Server instead of attempting a direct connection.

1.  **Create a New Connection Record:**
    *   Navigate back to **Connections & Credentials > Connection & Credential Aliases** and open the `Docker` alias.
    *   Create a new Connection record (e.g., "Docker via MID Server").

2.  **Configure the Connection to Use the MID Server:**
    *   In the new connection form, check the box for **Use MID server**.
    *   In the **MID Server** field that appears, select the `Azure_Linux_MID` you just installed and validated.
    *   The **Connection URL** should still point to the local Docker daemon from the MID Server's perspective (e.g., `https://localhost:2376` or `https://127.0.0.1:2376`), as the MID Server will be making the connection locally on the VM.

By following these high-level steps, you replace the problematic direct, inbound mTLS connection with the standard, robust outbound MID Server architecture, effectively bypassing the handshake issue.
