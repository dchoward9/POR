# CONFIG_AppDefinition.md

## Purpose
To define the core properties and metadata of the "Partner Onboarding" scoped application within the ServiceNow platform. This component acts as the container for all other components in the project.

## Current Implementation Status
âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Component exists and is functional

## Implementation Details
- **Location**: `metadata/sys_app_2ac1af2e931ea290d5ec31697bba10f0.xml`
- **Current interfaces**: This record is managed through the ServiceNow Studio or the `sys_app` table. It defines the application's scope (`x_1118046_partne_0`), name, version, and default roles.
- **Dependencies**: None. This is the root component.
- **Dependents**: All other components in the project are dependent on this application record, as they are all created within its scope.

## Core Logic & Functionality
This is a metadata record, not an executable component. Its primary functions are:
-   **Encapsulation:** It logically groups all related records (tables, scripts, flows, UI components) into a single, manageable application.
-   **Scoping:** It creates a unique namespace (`x_1118046_partne_0`) to prevent naming conflicts with other applications on the same ServiceNow instance.
-   **Security:** It defines the default user roles for the application, which are then used by ACLs to grant permissions.
-   **Deployment:** It serves as the primary package for deployment, either through the ServiceNow App Repo or via source control.

## Current Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: The application record is fully configured with a name, description, and defined scope.
- **Code Quality**: N/A (This is a configuration record).
- **Test Coverage**: N/A.
- **Documentation**: The record has a clear short description.

## Technical Debt & Improvement Areas
- None identified.

## Interface Definition
```xml
<!-- Simplified representation of the application record -->
<sys_app>
    <name>Partner Onboarding</name>
    <scope>x_1118046_partne_0</scope>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <short_description>
        This scoped application is used to track requests and tasks related to partner onboarding...
    </short_description>
    <user_role display_value="x_1118046_partne_0.viewer" />
</sys_app>
```

## ARC Verification Criteria

### Input Validation Criteria  
- [ ] N/A

### Error Handling Criteria
- [ ] N/A

### Quality Criteria
- [ ] Verify the application has a clear and concise short description.
- [ ] Verify the application has a defined user role for basic access.
