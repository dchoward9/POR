# UI_RequestView.md

## Purpose
To define the default form layout for the `x_1118046_partne_0_requests` table. This component controls which fields are displayed, in what order, and how they are grouped into sections when a user views a Request record.

## Current Implementation Status
âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Component exists and is functional

## Implementation Details
- **Location**: `metadata/update/sys_ui_section_*.xml` and `metadata/update/sys_ui_form_sections_*.xml` records for the `x_1118046_partne_0_requests` table with a default view.
- **Current interfaces**: This is a UI configuration that dictates the rendering of a record form.
- **Dependencies**: `MODEL_Request`.
- **Dependents**: Any user who views a Request record through the standard platform UI.

## Core Logic & Functionality
This component is a collection of UI configuration records that define the default view. The layout is structured into logical sections:
1.  **Main Section (unnamed):**
    -   Displays the primary identifying and status information in a two-column layout.
    -   **Left Column:** `number`, `requested_for`, `manager`.
    -   **Right Column:** `state`, `stage`, `requested_by`.
    -   Followed by the full-width `short_description` field.
2.  **Partner Information Section:**
    -   Displays all the detailed information about the partner.
    -   Includes fields like `partner_full_legal_name`, `partner_contact_information`, `description_of_services`, `business_justification`, `sensitive_data_access`, and `university`.
3.  **Work Notes Section:**
    -   Displays the journal fields for communication.
    -   Includes `watch_list`, `comments` (customer visible), and `work_notes` (internal).
    -   Also includes the full activity log formatter.

## Current Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: The form view is well-organized and presents all relevant information for a user or fulfiller.
- **Code Quality**: N/A (UI Configuration).
- **Test Coverage**: The ATF suite opens and validates fields on this view as part of its tests.
- **Documentation**: The sections are clearly captioned.

## Technical Debt & Improvement Areas
- None identified.

## Interface Definition
```
// This is a UI configuration, not an API.
// It is the default view rendered when a user navigates to a Request record.
