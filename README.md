## üéØ Business Problem & Solution

This application solves the business challenge of tracking and managing partner onboarding requests, which require sequential and parallel tasks across multiple departments (Legal, Procurement, Security, Finance).

The solution automates this entire lifecycle, from initial request submission in the Service Catalog to the final task closure, providing full visibility to stakeholders and ensuring a consistent, auditable process.

## ‚ú® Key Technical Features

### Back-End Development
*   **Automation Engine:** The core logic is powered by a data-driven **Flow Designer** process that utilizes a reusable **subflow** and a **custom-scripted Action**. This allows for a flexible, low-code approach to process changes.
*   **Server-Side Scripting:** Data integrity and complex state transitions are managed by server-side JavaScript in **Business Rules**.
*   **Modular Code:** A client-callable **Script Include** is used for real-time, server-side validation from the front-end, demonstrating a best-practice approach to reusable code.

### Front-End Development
*   **User Interface:** The user-facing experience is a **Service Catalog Record Producer**, featuring 10+ variables to capture all necessary information.
*   **Dynamic Experience:** The form is made dynamic and responsive using **UI Policies** and **Client Scripts**, including a `GlideAjax` call for real-time validation of user input.

### Data Model & Security
*   **Architecture:** Built on a foundation of three custom tables (`Requests`, `Tasks`, `Task Config`) with defined relationships and **dictionary overrides**.
*   **Security:** The application is secured with over 50 granular, role-based **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, ensuring that users can only see and interact with the data relevant to their function.
