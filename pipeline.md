Of course. This is a critical detail that makes the scenario much more realistic. Having separate instances for development and testing is a standard best practice. This changes the project plan slightly, particularly around credentials and pipeline stages, but the core principles remain the same.

Here is the revised, high-level plan to recreate this workflow using two PDIs and Azure DevOps.

---

### **Phase 0: Prerequisites & Initial Setup (The Foundation)**

This is the one-time setup to get your tools and environments in place.

1.  **Get Your Accounts & Instances:**
    *   **Azure DevOps:** Ensure you have your free account at `dev.azure.com`.
    *   **ServiceNow PDIs:**
        *   Designate one PDI as your **`DEV`** instance. This is where developers will work.
        *   Designate your second PDI as your **`QA`** instance. This is the "box" the pipeline will use for testing. **Important:** Keep this instance clean; the pipeline will overwrite it.

2.  **Install the Bridge:**
    *   In your Azure DevOps organization, go to the **Marketplace** and install the free "ServiceNow CI/CD" extension.

3.  **Prepare Your Application:**
    *   On your **`DEV`** instance, install your "Partner Onboarding Request" (POR) application.
    *   Link the application in Studio to a Git repository.

---

### **Phase 1: Create Your Quality Standard in ServiceNow (The Tests)**

This work is done on your **`QA`** instance, as it is the designated testing environment.

1.  **Clone the Application to QA:**
    *   On your **`QA`** instance, navigate to **System Applications -> Studio**.
    *   Click **"Import From Source Control"** and use the same Git repository URL from your `DEV` instance to install a clean copy of the POR application.

2.  **Create the Smoke Test Suite on QA:**
    *   On your **`QA`** instance, navigate to the **Automated Test Framework (ATF)**.
    *   Create a new **Test Suite** named `POR - PR Smoke Tests`.
    *   Build the critical tests we designed previously. **Crucially, ensure all tests are designed to run against the data and users that exist on your `QA` instance.**

3.  **Get the Test Suite ID:**
    *   From the `POR - PR Smoke Tests` suite on your **`QA`** instance, right-click the header and **"Copy sys_id"**. Save this for later.

---

### **Phase 2: Set Up Your Code Hub & Credentials in Azure DevOps**

This is where you'll manage the code and securely store the credentials for both of your PDIs.

1.  **Create an Azure DevOps Project:**
    *   Create a new project, e.g., `Partner Onboarding Governance`.

2.  **Import Your Application Code:**
    *   In your new project, go to **Repos -> Files** and import the Git repository for your POR application. This makes Azure DevOps the central source of truth.

3.  **Create Two Service Connections (The Keys):**
    *   This is the most important change. You need to teach Azure DevOps how to talk to *both* of your instances.
    *   Go to **Project Settings -> Service connections**.
    *   **Create the `DEV` Connection:**
        *   Click "Create service connection," find **"ServiceNow CI/CD."**
        *   Enter your **`DEV`** instance URL and admin credentials.
        *   Name it `servicenow-dev-connection`.
    *   **Create the `QA` Connection:**
        *   Repeat the process.
        *   Enter your **`QA`** instance URL and admin credentials.
        *   Name it `servicenow-qa-connection`.

---

### **Phase 3: Build the Automation (The Pipeline & The Gate)**

This is where you define the multi-instance workflow.

1.  **Create the Pipeline Recipe (YAML File):**
    *   In **Repos -> Files**, create a new file named `azure-pipelines.yml`.
    *   Copy and paste the "Superior, Content-Aware" YAML script.
    *   **Make the following critical edits:**
        *   In the `variables` section, paste the `sys_id` of your test suite from the **`QA`** instance.
        *   In the `ServiceNow-CICD-SC-Apply` task, set the `connectedServiceName` to **`servicenow-qa-connection`**. This tells the pipeline to deploy the code to your QA instance.
        *   In the `ServiceNow-CICD-TestSuite-Run` task, set the `connectedServiceName` to **`servicenow-qa-connection`**. This tells the pipeline to run the tests on your QA instance.
    *   Commit the new file to your `master` branch.

2.  **Create the Quality Gate (Branch Policy):**
    *   Go to **Repos -> Branches**.
    *   On the `master` branch, click the three dots (...) and select **"Branch policies."**
    *   Under **"Build Validation,"** add a new policy.
    *   Select your new pipeline and set it to **"Required."** This enforces the quality check before any code can be merged.

---

### **Phase 4: See It in Action (The End-to-End Workflow)**

This proves the entire multi-instance process works.

1.  **The Developer's Work (on `DEV`):**
    *   In your **`DEV`** instance Studio, create a new branch from `master` (e.g., `feature/real-world-test`).
    *   Make a code change.
    *   Use Studio to commit the change to the feature branch.

2.  **The Quality Gate (in Azure DevOps):**
    *   In Azure DevOps, create a **Pull Request** to merge your feature branch into `master`.
    *   **Observe:** The pipeline automatically starts. It will:
        1.  Read the code from your feature branch.
        2.  Use the **`servicenow-qa-connection`** to deploy that code to your **`QA`** instance, overwriting what's there.
        3.  Use the **`servicenow-qa-connection`** again to run the ATF smoke test suite on your **`QA`** instance.
        4.  Based on the pass/fail result, it will either **allow or block** the merge button on the Pull Request.

You have now successfully built a real-world CI pipeline that mirrors a production setup: development happens in one instance, and automated testing happens in a completely separate, dedicated QA instance.
